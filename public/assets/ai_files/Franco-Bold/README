Franko and Franco
=================


The Great Renaming
------------------

Franko is Roboto v1.2.310 with the feature set rewritten for less surprise.
Franco is Roboto Condensed v1.2.311 given the same treatment. Both were
renamed to minimise name clash. They are still Apache-licensed, of course.

You may remember that Roboto v1 was nicknamed 'the four-headed Frankenfont'.
The names Franko and Franco (FRANko COndensed) derive from that.

The TTF files are not hinted. I have never found any hinted v1.2 files.


Feature list
------------

Existing features, mentioned in application order:

smcp/pcap: Convert minuscules to small/petite caps. Since Franko and Franco
have only petite caps (only as tall as the minuscules themselves), they are
mapped onto both 'smcp' and 'pcap': The former for maximum availability, the
latter because they *are* petite caps. They should also decompose the four
extant ligatures, but I haven't got around to test that.

c2sc/c2pc: Convert majuscules to small/petite caps. Same sob story as smcp
and pcap.

liga: Ligates the common combinations of 'fi', 'fl', 'ffi' and 'ffl'.

pnum: The default numerals are lining/tabular. 'pnum' swings in lining/
proportionally-spaced numerals instead.

frac: Builds a few common fractions: 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 3/4 and 7/8. It
will also replace the sequences '0/0', 'O/O' and 'o/o' with a percent sign,
and the sequences '0/00', 'O/OO' and 'o/oo' with a permille sign.

ordn: Ordinal signs. Replaces 'a' and 'o' following numerals with the
corresponding ordinal signs.

ss01: Stylistic Set 1. Replaces 'g' with an alternate version.

ss02: Stylistic Set 2. Replaces the greek 'alpha' with an alternate version.

ss03: Stylistic Set 3. Replaces 'R' with an alternate version.

ss04: Stylistic Set 4. Replaces 'K'/'k' with alternate versions.

ss05: Stylistic Set 5. Replaces 'K'/'k' with different alternate versions.

There is currently no 'aalt' to Access All Alternates.
